# LocalWeatherBot
**Dislcaimer:** The training data available currently may be out of date. I will try my best to rectify this issue as this project continues.

## Overview and Features
This model is created using C# and intergrated within ML.NET, allowing for quick and easy training. This specific model is built using the Value Prediction model. It has also been trained on 24 years worth of data.

**Prediction Analysis:** This model is used to preidct the Maximum Temperature in Celcius(C) for the next day. As this predicts only the next day, I must figure out a way to automate this process.

## Model Performance
* **R-Squared:** This model measured as a 0.7785, meaning that it is around 78% correct in close predictions most of the time.
* **Status:** In development.

## Setup and Installation
As this project is not complete, please use an IDE if you wish to run this project.
**Prerequisites:**
1. .NET Core SDK (6.0 or later reccomended)
2. Visual Studio with .NET Desktop Enviroment installed (I have not tried out any other IDEs yet).
